                <p style="font-size:1rem; line-height:1.7; color:#333; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
                    During the term he was the Chairman of Zilla Parishad, he made several developments in the education
                    of girls and tribal and backward areas and extra curricular activities like songs and dramas. It was
                    considered to be a golden era. He took initiative for starting Kritiventi Perraju Panthulu Junior
                    Collge at Ramachandrapuram and also Agricultural Polytechnic at Ramachandrapuram in his name. He got
                    several moral instruction and also teaching of spiritual lessons printed and supplied to all
                    secondary schools in the district.
                </p>
                <p>During Gandhi Centenary Celebrations, he organized Essay Writing Competition for the students of High
                    Schools in the District and for those students who have come out successful in the competitions, he
                    also organized visit of all important places like Sabarmathi Ashram, Wardha, Birla Mandir, etc.
                    places connected with Gandhiji’s life and also made available the meeting of Smt. Indira Gandhi who
                    had appreciated their visit and blessed them. </p>
                <p>Tracing the beginning of irrigation systems in Andhra Pradesh, he got details of the life of Sri
                    ARTHUR COTTON who built the Godavari and Krishna Ayacuts nearly 130 years ago fully investigated and
                    got his biography published to commemorate his memory. This book is considered to be a standard book
                    of its kind by the Irrigation Department. Sri Satyanarayana Rao was affectionately called as
                    “UPADHYAYA BANDHU”. Another activity of irrigation is when there is a breach to the Godavari Bund in
                    the year 1953 and 1956 at Kapileswarapuram and Kulla, the services rendered to flood victims by Sri
                    Rao were appreciated by Sri Chandulal Trivedi, the then Governor of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
                <p>During the Pakistan war, East Godavari District secured No.1 position in collecting donations to war
                    fund and gold under his able leadership and the then Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Sastry made a
                    special visit to the District and personally received the gold collected from Sri Satyanarayana Rao.
                </p>
                <p>During his capacity as M.P., he utilized Constituency Development Fund and other Development Funds to
                    a tune of 12.17 crores for Rural Development taking about 5 to 600 works towards creating
                    infrastructure like roads and bridges and helping the poor SCs, STs and BCs and other Minorities.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #005c62; font-size: x-large;">‘‘In Industries, he got employed nearly 15000 people
                    directly or indirectly. For such innovative work,
                    he was honoured with the title of ‘VIJAYA RATNA’.’’</p>
                <p>On the cultural activities, besides starting Harikatha Patasala and Veda Patasala at
                    Kapileswarapuram, he distributed 18 Lalita Kala Puraskarams and 18 Sahitya Puraskarams giving
                    outstanding persons in those fields respectively. He loved all those persons as members of the
                    family and they in their turn considered that they are the members of his family. That is how he
                    loved people and people loved him.</p>
                <p>He was born in a family of Zamindars, a noble family and his actions and utterances are nobler and
                    ideal for other contemporaries to follow. We can call him ‘Raja Satyanarayana’.</p>
                <p>He has got a great regard for his father Sri B.C. Sarvaraya, a majestic personality with his turban
                    and hence, he established a number of institutions in his name, both industrial, financial and
                    educational. </p>
                <p>His brother Sri B.P. Pattabhirama Rao occupied the post of Minister of State for Industries for some
                    time and also for Finance for some time during the period when Smt. Indira Gandhi was the Prime
                    Minister.</p>

                <p>Sri S.B.P.B.K. published Subhashitha Ratna Mala in nine volumes published by Sarvaraya Sugars
                    covering different religions</p>
                <ul style="padding-left:1.2rem; list-style:disc; color:#333; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6;">

                    <li><strong>Utterances of Sankara Bhagavat Pada</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Utterances of Goutama Budha</strong></li>

                    <li><strong>Sri Nanak</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus, he has established the idea of integration of all religions together, in this multi-religious
                    country of ours. In his units of industry and even in cultural units, he employed all people of
                    Christians, Muslims, Dalits and Non-Dalits as he has imbibed the norm of this Vedic religion, which
                    is not a religion but a way of life. Thus, he helped for the integration of the nation very much in
                    his activity and also in his utterances</p>
                <p>Sri S.B.P.B.K. has a deep knowledge of Sruti, Smruthi, Purana and Itihasas. He published 20 to 25
                    books of authors of great erudite scholarship of ancient times and himself read them intensively and
                    understood the philosophy behind those utterances. Accordingly, he got abiding faith in the
                    utterance of Sage Veda Vyasa, the author of Maha Bharata, who said, <strong
                        style="font-size: larger;"> “I will disclose a great secret
                        – there is no position superior to that of humanity”,</strong> and hence, every intelligent man
                    should try to
                    acquire liberation of the soul, which is known as Atma Siddhi by Veda, as man alone is endowed with
                    the faculty of acquiring liberation of soul. For that, one should follow the concept of Dharma, a
                    duty oriented, which involves sacrifice and said that man should follow five concepts of
                    <strong>‘Dharmam,
                        Srutam, Tapas, Diksha, Vyavasayam’</strong> i.e., earn money on proper way, study subject,
                    concentrate on
                    work, take a owe having an object of establishing institutions of permanent value and for that
                    purpose constantly make effort which is last thing called as Vyavasaya. He did all these things with
                    such a dedicated mind that he created a source for Dharmic work.
                </p>
                <p>Unlike Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya who declared that ‘I am the greatest beggar’, and secured
                    donations from several persons, Sri S.B.P.B.K. secured a source for Dharmik work himself, and used
                    the same for Dharmik work. For this work of Pravruthi Marga, he established number of units
                    -industrial and financial and the social and cultural work established by him constantly grew from
                    strength to strength in view of the permanent source of wealth from those units. Hence he believes
                    strongly that surplus money is not his and it is intended for distribution and he did accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, we can sum up his philosophy in life. One conspicuous feature of his life is, he has no
                    children. Himself or his Dharmapatni Smt. Rajarajeswaramma do not have any such feeling of the
                    absence of progeny at any time. They both accept with full faith the utterance of the Sruti that
                    every human being should attain immortality by practicing Pravruthi Dharma initially, by working
                    vigorously to secure wealth and in the end of life he should attain immortality by
                    sacrificing/discarding all activities, progeny and wealth. Not by work, not by progeny, not by
                    wealth, by renunciation alone one attains immortality – tayagenaikenamrtatva manasuh. Sri S.B.P.B.K.
                    followed these concepts and ended his life with total sacrifice.</p>
                <p>He lived 90 years and his 60 years career clearly warrants a posthumous
                    national award to be given to
                    his personality by the Union of India.</p>

                    <p>We have two Itihasas – One <strong> Srimad Ramayana </strong> and another <strong> Sri
                            Mahabharata.
                        </strong></p>
                    <p>These two are heroic histories of our country. But they have definite message for the humanity.
                        Ramayana is verily the Veda transmuted into Kavya by Sage Valmiki. Sri Mahabharata is known as
                        5th
                        Veda containing the essence of Vedas and experience of sages who practiced those concepts. Hence
                        both of them embody the concepts mentioned in Veda. Hence, we have to correlate the vedic hymns
                        with
                        the concepts given in these two epics by sages. The message of both these epics is the same,
                        namely,
                        man’s duty to perform Dharma in life. Ramayana says, ‘Dharmasaram Idam Jagat’ from Dharma
                        follows
                        wealth, form Dharma comes happiness. By recourse to Dharma, one gets everything. Na sukhath
                        Labyate
                        sukham. Dharma does not follow from merriment.</p>
                    <p>The epic Maha Bharata is the biggest in its composition, seven times as great as the Iliad and
                        Odyssey combined, animating the hearts of Indians over thousands of years, which will continue
                        to do
                        so in future.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Sage Veda Vyasa, herein after called, Maharsi, himself given the message of this epic at the end
                        of this magnificent work. It is named as Bharata Savitri.</p>
                    <span>He Said,</span>

                        <li>Thousands of mothers, and fathers, and hundreds of sons and wives arise in the world
                            and depart from it. Others will arise and similarly go away. There are thousands of
                            occasions for joy and hundreds of occasions for fears. These affect only him who is
                            ignorant but never him that is wise”</li>
                        <li>With uplifted arms I am crying aloud, but nobody hears me. From Dharma originate profit and
                            pleasure. Why should not Dharma, therefore, be sought? For the sake of pleasure or fear, or
                            cupidity, or even for life one should not forsake Dharma</li>
                        <li>Dharma is eternal. Pleasure and pain are not eternal. Jiva is eternal. The cause,
                            however, of Jivas being invested with a body is not eternal.” </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If we know the explicit and implicit meaning of this message, we will be knowing fully the scheme
                        of his work.</p>

                <div class="speech">
                    <p>Maharsi Veda Vyasa said, <strong style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> “I will disclose a great secret –
                            there is no position
                            superior to that
                            of humanity”</strong>. Hence, he said, every intelligent man should try to acquire
                        liberation of the
                        soul, which is known as Atma Siddhi by Veda, as man alone is endowed with the faculty of
                        acquiring liberation of soul. Veda is the source of all Dharma. It prescribes the means for Atma
                        Siddhi in two ways known as Pravrtti and Nivrtti Dharma and prescribes the mode of practicing
                        the same. </p>
                    <span>The concept of Dharma is a duty oriented. It involves sacrifice. The summery thereof:-</span>
                    <ul
                        style="padding-left:1.2rem; list-style:disc; color:#333; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.6; text-align: justify;">
                        <li>Pravrthi Dhrama involves sacrificing in some measure’ Nivrthi Dharma total sacrifice’. One
                            in a million alone can follow it. Pravrthi Dharma must be followed by all. </li>
                        <li>Maharshi examined all Dhramas mentioned in Sruti, Smrti, Puranas and also Acharas
                            (traditional concepts of Dharma). </li>
                        <li>Maharshi said ‘one should practice 3 essential dharmas- Dama, Daya, Dana. Keeping oneself
                            within the bounds is Dama. Self control is its essence. Daya is compassion. Dana is charity.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you fail to practice these three, you will meet with opposites – kama, krodha, lobha.-
                            they are door ways of hell.</li>
                        <li>How to practice these dharmas?;- <strong> Yagna, Dana, Tapas. </strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="list-style: none;">1. Yagna means total sacrifice,</li>

                                <p>The first two for the society
                                    and the 3rd is for the individual.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Maharshi said the practice of dharma must be intensive, and hence one should without
                            transgressing Dharma acquire srutham–science; tapas – concentration; diksa – vow; and
                            vyavasayam - effort. One should become a first class citizen in any field he works. Maharsi
                            said, affluence, prosperity, modesty, contentment and fame reside in skill and labour, not
                            in idleness (MB-12-27-32).</li>
                        <li>You must acquire knowledge through physical science, moral science and spiritual science.
                            Through knowledge of physical science – a study of external world, you will get money and
                            gratify your senses and you also get awareness of several things in the world. Through moral
                            science – a study of internal world, it gives virtue like dama, which is the basic concept
                            for all Dharmas. Through spiritual science man gets integrated and knows how to lead an
                            ideal manhood.</li>
                        <li>Nasti Siddhih Akarmanah – no one gets success unless works intensively.</li>
                        <li>A very significant lesson we must know in this context. That is Virat created dharma after
                            creating beings for their well being. A direct text from Brhadranyaka Upanisad is as,
                            follows (I, iv. 14) Yet he did not flourish. He specially projected that excellent form,
                            dharma (righteousness). This dharma is the controller of the Ksatriaya. Therefore there is
                            nothing higher than that. So even a weak man hopes to defeat a stronger man through dharma
                            as one contending with the king. That dharma is verily truth, Therefore they say about a
                            person speaking truth, ‘He speaks of dharma’ or about a person speaking of dharma, ‘He
                            speaks of truth,’ for both these are but dharma.
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <p>We note here two things:</p>
                                <li style="list-style: decimal;"> Dharma is akin to rule of law which binds all persons
                                    including
                                    the ruler.</li>
                                <li style="list-style: decimal;">Dharma and truth are the same, so they are inter
                                    changeable words. Hence
                                    Yatho
                                    darmah thatho jayah- wherever there is darma, there lies success. Similarly
                                    Satyameva
                                    jayathe- truth also triumphs but not falsehood.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dharmo Viswasya Jagatahprathista - dharma supports the universe. It is supreme means of the
                            liberation. A significant thing is all beings protect their children. That is how the
                            activity in the world is carried on. See the hen, a pigeon, a cow – it licks and licks the
                            calf and make her clean. There is no reciprocity on the part of their offsprings towards
                            their parents. A stud bull cannot recognize their mother cow. In villages they prevent it.
                            But, there is no prohibition for it. The obligation of reciprocity is enjoined only on human
                            beings. Dharma, the righteousness is the origin of mankind. Dharma is the nector of the
                            gods. After leaving this body, man enjoys, through Dharma, the eternal felicity
                            (MB-12-193-33). The gods without any exception have to take birth as mortals on earth if
                            they violate dharma. Likewise, all mortals succeed in acquiring the dignity of gods by
                            practicing dharma (MB-12-258-41).
                        </li>
                        <li>We got political freedom and with that, we also should get social responsibility. In
                            democracy, a citizen passes the law as a sovereign, as a subject he should obey it. On the
                            other hand, after independence, we see increase of indiscipline, law breaking, crime, sex
                            and drug, explosions are increasing. Hence, Swami Ranganathananda emphasized that there
                            should be spiritual orientation of our democracy. Freedom, without citizenship qualities, is
                            dangerous and harmful to the humanity and to the globe as a whole.</li>

                            <li>Plato in his work ‘Republic’ described four types of unjust societies: timocracy,
                                oligarchy or plutocracy, democracy and tyranny or despotism, in ascending order from
                                least unjust to the most unjust. With reference to democracy, he described democracy as
                                the third worst state. He said: It will result into a debtor nation, people borrow at
                                high interest from the oligarchy, they will suffer bankruptcy. All people receive equal
                                rights. They lack discipline. Politicians with no training will lead the public. They go
                                on catering to the whims of the people. Like oligarchy, it lacks unity because people
                                work for selfish motives instead of for the good of the state. However, we see, in the
                                absence of other alternative, we have to resort to democracy. However, if the cardinal
                                principles of virtue mentioned by Socrates are imbibed, democracy will be the happiest

                                political doctrines. On the other hand, Sri Aurobindo said, they are the eternal
                                attributes of spirit and the practical recognition of the truth. How it is, I shall show

                            <li>Equality is a mandate against the State, but not against co-citizen. The liberty we

                                society that aims at equality must sacrifice liberty. Similarly, a society which aims at
                                liberty, must sacrifice equality. A man or society, so long they live in individual or
                                communal ego, strife comes. The only remedy is the fraternity, which cannot be enforced
                                in a court of law. However, our constitution was amended enumerating duties also
                                indicating that the court can interpret rights in the light of those duties. Hence, we
                                have to resort to the concept of Dharma, a practice of which by all citizens, promote
                                cordiality among themselves. </li>

                    <p>I divide this topic into five parts viz., Age of Ramayana, its Message, its Source, Commentary
                        thereon, Relevancy – both social order and democracy.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="color: #005c62;">
                    <h5>AGE :</h5>
                    <p>It is well known that Ramayana is a very ancient epic in this country. Everyone knows the same.
                        Its impact is green in the minds of humanity in spite of its origin beyond history. It is
                        necessary to give its age, so that we could know its glory and its impact on humanity and its
                        perennial message to humanity. In our country, our ancestors studied both astrology and
                        astronomy and a clear measure of time of all events is recorded by them.</p>
                    <p>Almanac prepared in the earlier periods used to state as 1,25,69,013 as the Ravanabdas and
                        1,25,58,031 as Sri Rama’s Rajayantabadas (years) if we deduct the later figure from the earlier
                        figure of Ravanabdas’s it comes 11,000 years which was the total number of years of Sri Rama’s
                        rule and that clearly synchronizes with the period mentioned by the poet Valmiki in this epic.
                        In Bramhanda Purana, it was mentioned that Sri Rama was born in Tretayuga on 24th Maha yuga. If
                        we calculate as per that data we must exclude the Krutayuga of 24th Maha yuga and entire Treta
                        yuga except 11,000 years (as Sri Rama was said to have been born at the end of Treta yuga after
                        the sage Parasurama repetedly killed kshatriya race of the world) add the years of all the four
                        yugas in 25th, 26th 27th and the present 28th Maha yuga upto this period which comes to
                        1,81,60,100 years by 1999 AD.</p>
                    <p>Kota Venkatachalam, a Vedic Scholar in his work Brahmanda Sristi Vijnanam in Telugu quoted a
                        great Scholar Parvatam Nrusimha Deekshitulu as stating that the incarnation of Rama is of
                        1,46,16,000 years. In that reference, he has given other incarnations also. Hence, Sri
                        Venkatachalam remarked that the statement in almanacs may require study as some error appears to
                        have been crept in them. Further, Mulukutla Nrusimha Avadhani in his Ramayana Sara Sidhantham
                        mentioned useful information regarding this. </p>
                    <p>It is true, scholars and investigators may differ on this question. However, this data is not
                        meaningless. In a clear and methodical way our ancestors maintained this record and hence, it is
                        incumbent on the part of this Viswa Sahitya Sanskriti Samsthan, New Delhi to make a thorough
                        research and secure an authentic data through scholars.</p>
                </div>
                <div style="color: #005c62;">
                    <h5>MESSAGE:</h5>
                    <p>Regarding message, Ramayana specifically mentions three concepts of Kama, Artha and extensively
                        the subject of Dharma[ Kamartha Guna Samyuktam; Dharmardha Guna Vistaram (1-3-8 – Valmiki
                        Ramayana) ]. Hence, the poet also said, Dharma follows wealth, from Dharma comes happiness, by
                        recourse to Dharma one gets everything. Dharma is the essence of this world[ Aranya Kanda,
                        Ch.9-30.] The concepts of Dharma and Satya are interchangeable and hence, Sage Valmiki
                        extensively portrayed the character of Sri Rama as Satya Dharma Parayana - who practised Truth
                        and Dharma with abiding faith. Though Ramayana did not mention the metaphysics or the concept of
                        Moksha, the practise of these concepts of Dharma, Artha and Kama within the bounds of Dharma
                        leads to redemption. Poet Valmiki built a great mansion of seven stories in the form of this
                        epic. Truth and Dharma are the two pillars of base. </p>
                    <p>Fillial devotion and matrimonial purity are the two towers of this mansion. The poet installed
                        Sri Rama in this mansion who is ever present whenever we open this book. Sri Rama practised
                        several forms of Dharma which have become virtues making him Lokottara Purusa. </p>
                </div>
                <div style="color: #005c62;">
                    <h5>SOURCE:</h5>
                    <p>Sage Valmiki himself said that he aims at elucidating the meaning of Vedas[ Vedartha
                        Brmhanarthaya – 1-4-6- Valmiki Ramayana]. In fact, Veda Vyasa (herein after called Maharsi)
                        said, Veda is transformed into Ramayana when the Lord visualised by Veda descended on earth as
                        Sri Rama[ Vedavedye Parepumsi Jate Dasaradhatmaje, Vedah Praceta Sadasit Sakshat Ramayanatmana –
                        Skanda Purana.]. It is well known that Taittiriya Upanisad 1-11 mentions 25 Dharmas starting
                        with Satyam Vada, Dharmam Cara. Similarly, Maha Narayana Upanisad mentions the concept of Truth,
                        Tapas, Dama (self-control), Sama (control of mind), Dana, Dharma, Performance of Sacrifices and
                        other means of liberation. Further, the Vedic Hymns mentions several concepts both for social
                        order and for redemption. It mentions Ayakshma sumana bhava – Free yourself from disease and
                        cultivate good mindedness towards others (Taittiriya Samhita 4-5-1). Similarly, Mitrena
                        cakshusapasya (Sukla Yajurveda 36-18) – See the whole world with friendly eyes. Rgveda also
                        mentions seven maryadas – sins to be avoided viz., Brahma Hatya (killing a Vedic Scholar), Steya
                        (stealing), Anyatalpa (Another’s bed - adultery), Anrta (telling a falsehood), Surapana
                        (drinking alcohol), minor sins such as, refusing admission for a guest, neglecting Pitru Karyas,
                        insulting elders. We cannot exhaust the several concepts mentioned in Veda and how they are
                        embodied in this epic. In fact, Manu said, Vedokhilo Dharma Mulam.</p>
                    <p>In this connection it is useful to note what Veda Vyasa said about the content of Veda. He said,
                        Vedas mention ten things for liberation of soul[ Maha Bharata, Santhi Parva, Ch.232-27]. They
                        are, study of Vedas, adoption of domestic mode of life, penance, observation of all duties,
                        common to all the modes of life, sacrifice, performance of all acts leading to pure fame,
                        meditation which is of three kinds, and that kind of liberation called Siddhi attainable in this
                        life. This definition is comprehensive embodying both Pravruthi and Nivruthi Dharma, concepts
                        enunciated by Sage Veda Vyasa. Apparently, Ramayana mentions Pravruthi Dharma only, though it
                        leads to Nivruthi Dharma. Hence, I take this opportunity to state that in every conference
                        conducted by this Institution should study to what extent the Vedic Hymns pertaining to several
                        topics of history, geography and science and other subjects and also other facets of Dharma are
                        embodied in this Epic. It requires a constant and vigilant study as Vedic Hymns are infinite
                        i.e., Ananta. </p>

                    <h5>COMMENTARY:</h5>
                    <p>Fortunately, like Greeks, we have got two Epics. The second Epic is Maha Bharata. It also aims at
                        disseminating the knowledge of Dharma extensively both Pravruthi and Nivruthi Dharmas. Thus, it
                        constitutes commentary on the concepts and precepts embodied in Ramayana. </p>
                    <p>In this connection, it is useful to compare these two epics and we will have the great advantage
                        of studying these concepts of Dharma mentioned extensively in both these Epics. If Ramayana
                        mentions an ancient story relating to moral or spiritual values, Maharsi crystalised and stated
                        them as rules. In Ramayana the story relating to Somada, Sage Poulasya, Sage Kasyapa begetting
                        children is stated by Maharsi thus. He said in different ages, birth took place by mere will, by
                        look or by touch. The intercourse of the couple came later. Similarly, sage Valmiki gave the
                        names of ten sage women such as Savitri and Damayanti. Maharsi gave the stories of all those
                        meritorious women and extensively the story of Savitri and Damayanti. In Yudha Kanda, when
                        Vibhisana sought asylum, Sugriva and other warriors warned Sri Rama not to accept him, as he was
                        the brother of the enemy Ravana. Sri Rama just mentioned, “Have you not heard the story of the
                        pigeon”. The story of pigeon is a very ancient story, long before Ramayana, that embodies the
                        compassion and hospitality. Maharsi gave extensively eight Chapters about that story and he
                        further said how the pigeons redeemed themselves and reached higher regions of heaven. Thus, it
                        is said, Ramayana is Laksya Grandha, whereas Mahabharata is a Laksana Grandha. Maharsi gave the
                        science of dharma for us. He defined what is dharma, why we should we practice dharma, what are
                        the precautions to be taken, what is the advantage of practising it, what are the obstacles for
                        practising it, what are the means of practising it. He fully explained the theory of dharma in
                        several aspects. He defined as many as 30 dharmas. He began with the Vedic Hymn “Dharmo visvasya
                        jagatah pratistha”[ Mahanarayana Upanisad, - 79 Anuvaka] dharma is the support of the whole
                        universe. He amplified it saying the rules of Dharma are sanctioned for the conduct of the
                        affairs of the world[ Lokayatrarthameveha dharmasya niyamah krtah – Santi Parva Chapter 259-4],
                        for keeping the world together[ Lokasamgraha samyuktam – Santi Parva 259-26], for promoting
                        advancement and growth of all beings[ Prabhavarthaya bhutanam dharma pravacanam – Santi Parva
                        109-10], for maintaining and upholding all beings[ Yatsyat dharanasamyuktam sa dharmahiti
                        niscayah – Santi Parva 109-10] and for securing non-injury for all beings[ Ahimsarthaya bhutanam
                        dharma pravacanam krtam – Santi Parva 109-11]. He also said that anything that is delightfully
                        agreeable is Dharma[ Sarvam Priyabhyupagatam – Santi Parva 259-25] and the rules of Dharma are
                        ancient, universal, friendly, beneficial and eternal[ Sanatanam, Sarvabhutahitam, Maitram,
                        Puranam – Santi Parva 262-10].</p>
                    <p>The literal meaning of dharma is Dharati Lokaniti Dharmah – Dharma bears the world; Dhryate va
                        Janairiti Dharmah – people bear Dharma. It is a rule of conduct enjoined to every human being as
                        a duty.</p>
                    <p>Maharsi, having stated the several facets of Dharma, still gave all embracing working rules for
                        humanity thus[ Anusasana parva 22-25]: Maryadayam sthito Dharmah: Keeping oneself within bounds
                        is Dharma and Samascaivasya Laksanam – Self-control is its essence. Secondly, he summed up the
                        theory of dharma in practice thus: “That which is antagonistic to one’s own self should never be
                        done in respect of another. Briefly this is dharma”[ Na tat Parasya Sandadhyat Pratikulam
                        yadatmanah – Mahabharata Udyogaparva 39-72
                        ].</p>
                    <p>Further, Ramayana expounded the necessity of a king and also the state craft in Ch.67 and 100 of
                        Ayodhya Kanda. Maharsi extensively explained these concepts in Santi Parva under the Chapters of
                        Raja Dharma and Apadharma. Sri Rama practised all these Dharmas and showed ever lasting path to
                        the humanity to follow his practice of these dharmas. </p>

                    <h5>RELEVANCY:</h5>
                    <p>I have divided the relevancy in two parts viz., for social order and for the democracy.</p>
                    <p>The modern man is under a mistaken impression that the concept of Dharma is a religious concept
                        and he says that in the set up of democracy we require equality, liberty and fraternity, the
                        political norms. It is equally a mistake to think that the three doctrines embodied in the
                        Constitution of our country and other countries throughout the world are political doctrines. In
                        fact, the three concepts are God Heads of Soul and as observed by Aurobindo. He observed, </p>
                    <p>“Freedom, equality, brotherhood are three godheads of the soul; they cannot be really achieved
                        through the external machinery of society or by a man so long as he lives only in the individual
                        and the communal ego. When the ego claims liberty, it arrives at competitive individualism. When
                        it asserts equality, it arrives first at strife, then at an attempt to ignore the variations of
                        Nature, and, as the sole way of doing that successfully, it constructs an artificial and
                        machine-made society. A society that pursues liberty as its ideal is unable to achieve equality;
                        a society that aims at equality will be obliged to sacrifice liberty. For the ego to speak of
                        fraternity is for it to speak of something contrary to its nature”. </p>
                    <p>Hence he said, the brotherhood is the real key to the triple gospel of the idea of humanity. We
                        cannot achieve these objects embodied in the Constitution as they are really virtues – different
                        facets of dharma. Inspite of loud proclamation of these precepts, humanity has not really won
                        them. Is it possible to practice precept of fraternity when persons born to the same parents
                        look with reservation, suspicion, hatred and kill each other for property? Fraternity is not
                        even claimed to be an enforceable principle. Equality can be enforced only against state but not
                        against a co-citizen. The liberty we enjoy is really empty and unreal. Even married couple
                        cannot move freely in the streets, let alone unmarried girls. Unless citizens follow Dharma and
                        become virtuous, the state alone cannot enforce these doctrines and achieve the goal. </p>
